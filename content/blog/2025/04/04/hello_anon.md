## Welcome to my blog

I've setup _eleventy_ to get some simple site generation going and replace my janky lua scripts. It has [a nice sample](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy-base-blog) that I used to get started. I simplified my version even further.

Played with it a bit and so far so good.

## What will I talk about?

Take a look at my [~~twitter~~ x.com feed](https://x.com/morew4rd), it will likely look similar. But more in depth. Probably ðŸ˜…

Truth is it's impossible to predict the future, so we'll see.

## Comments?

Too much work to directly support them. Hola at me at X, email, discord or elsewhere.

## Who are you?

I'm an anon who likes to build things. Some links in the main page.
